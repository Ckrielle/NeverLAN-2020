Another unorthodox approach. This time we had to get the flag from a binary file. To read binaries the command strings is used. However the output was long. So since I was braindead and couldn't use grep, I noticed that the length of the lines wasnt't much. So through stdout I made a file with the output of the strings command and then I did cat out.txt | awk '{ print length, $0 }' | sort -n -s | cut -d" " -f2-. I found the one liner on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5917576/sort-a-text-file-by-line-length-including-spaces, and I was proven right when the flag was the dead last.
