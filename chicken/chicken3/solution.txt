Along with the flag I provide my command history. I opened the BAWK.txt file and seeing the many BAWKS I understood that I needed to find the flag amidst all of them. Though grep is the obvious I didn't know what to put as a pattern (yes I went braindead and didn't remember that leveln had been used in the previous). So I decided to work with awk, as I was inspired from the awk part of bawk. However after some tinkering I decided to drop it, as I found tr. After checking that the shell has it I removed all the BAWKS, which to my surprise left all the spaces. After I removed them I got the flag. Not the most obvious/smarter of ways but a way non the less.
